I was challenged by someone to make a program that lets you input the values for variables x and y that also uses if and if else statements to determine a printf response based on what happened, this is why the folder with the source is named "TheChallenge". 
this is my attempt at this challenge, at the very least it compiled succesfully with my build environment.
